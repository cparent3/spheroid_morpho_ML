# spheroid_morpho_ML

This project aims to **segment spheroid images**, extract their **morphological properties**, and use **MIIC algorithm** to study the relative importance of the morpholigical features before using **machine learning** to **classify spheroids based on viability** and **predict dose-response curves**.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Segmentation** (`segmentation_images/`)  
This folder contains **`spheroid_segmentation.py`** to extract **spheroid morphological properties** from images.  
üì∏ **Example images** are included for testing in `segmentation_images/data_segmentation`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ MIIC** (`MIIC/`) 
This folder contains: **`1_prepare_miic_input.py`** and **`2_miic.R`** to obtain **MIIC networks**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Classification and Prediction** (`machine_learning_classification/`)  
This folder contains **notebooks for spheroid classification**:  
- **`1_data_processing_spheroids_morpho.ipynb`**: Data preprocessing to structure spheroid morphological properties.  
- **`2_data_exploration_spheroids_morpho.ipynb`**: Data visualization.  
- **`3_machine_learning_spheroids_morpho.ipynb`**: Machine learning implementation to **classify spheroids based on viability** and **predict dose-response curves**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites**  
- Tested with **Python 3.12.7**  
- **Dependencies** (install with pip):  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites for MIIC**  
- Tested with **R version 4.4.1**  
- **Dependencies**:  
  ```bash
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rjson", "remotes"))
  remotes::install_github("miicTeam/miic_R_package@lmiic")


### **üöÄ Usage**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Segmentation
Run the script to script **`spheroid_segmentation.py`**. The masks, segented images and extracted properties are saved in the folder `segmentation_images/output`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ MIIC
 - Run `1_prepare_miic_input.py` to preprocess data
 - Run `2_miic` to obtain MIIC networks  
The files to upload on https://miic.curie.fr/vis_NL.php to visualize the networks are saved in the folder `MIIC/results`.  
The "_summary" file has to be uploaded as the Summary input, the "_processed" file as the Dataset input, the "_stateorder" file as the Category Order input, the "_orientations" file as the Edge Probabilities input.  
For proper visualization, the "layout/layout.json" file has to be uploaded as the Network layout input.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Spheroid Classification
 - Run `1_data_processing_spheroids_morpho.ipynb` to preprocess data
 - Run `2_data_exploration_spheroids_morpho.ipynb` to visualize data
 - Run `3_machine_learning_spheroids_morpho.ipynb` to train and test the model
